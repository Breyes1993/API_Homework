Three Observations
(You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.)

1. There is a correlation between temperature and latitude. Temperature gets hotter at the equator. 
   In my Temperature vs Latitude chart, the the hottest visible plot is near 100 degrees Fehrenheit.  

2. There is no strong correlation between latitude and humidity.

3. There is no strong correlation between latitude and cloudiness.

4. There is slight correlation between winds and latitude, as wind speeds seem stronger away from the equator.
